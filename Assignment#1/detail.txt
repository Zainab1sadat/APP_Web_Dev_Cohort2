Write HTML and CSS to create a photo gallery with at least four (4) thumbnails and one (1) main image.
Place the main image below the thumbnails. It should be bigger than the thumbnails. 
By default, the main image is the same as one of the thumbnails. Display a caption for the main image below the image.

At the bottom of the HTML file, write a <script> tag where you will write JavaScript to do the following:
When a user clicks a thumbnail:
Update the main image to the thumbnail image that was just clicked on.
Update the main image alternative text (alt attribute) to the thumbnail image that was just clicked on.
Update the main image caption to match the thumbnail image that was just clicked on.
