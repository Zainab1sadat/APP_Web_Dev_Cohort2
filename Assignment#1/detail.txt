Requirements
On your computer Desktop, create a new folder named APP-Web2-Assignment01. 

Open this folder in VS Code.

Using VS Code, in this folder, create a new HTML file named index.html and a CSS file named styles.css. Link the CSS file into HTML file.

Write HTML and CSS to create a photo gallery with at least four (4) thumbnails and one (1) main image.

Place the four thumbnails on the top of the page, next to each other. Hint: use CSS flexbox to make the images go next to each other.

Place the main image below the thumbnails. It should be bigger than the thumbnails. 

By default, the main image is the same as one of the thumbnails. Display a caption for the main image below the image.

The main image should be inside a <div>. Add a background color to this <div>.

Each image must have alternative text (alt attribute) that describes that image.

In the styles.css file, write CSS so that when a user hovers over a thumbnail, the thumbnail's opacity CSS property is reduced.

At the bottom of the HTML file, write a <script> tag where you will write JavaScript to do the following:

When a user clicks a thumbnail:

Update the main image to the thumbnail image that was just clicked on.

Update the main image alternative text (alt attribute) to the thumbnail image that was just clicked on.

Update the main image caption to match the thumbnail image that was just clicked on.
